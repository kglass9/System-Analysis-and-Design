# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client of this project is Driver Pass, liam and his IT admin want to desgin a system that will help people get ready for the driving test by offering pratice test and classes, and on-the-road driving session with trainers.

# What did you do particularly well?
  I feel what I did particularly well during this project is to use less technical jargon to explain my though process in the presentation slides. In the speaker notes, we were required to explain our finding in a nontechnical manner and I feel I excel in this aspect.
  
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  The one part of the work on these documents I would advise is my use case diagram. I feel I could have added a lot more details to this diagram to meet more client needs and requirements. I should of included more of how the DMV is involved as well as how the login function actually operates.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The way i interperted the user's needs throughout the design is by always referring back to that intital interview to make sure the user is getting every aspect that will help the succeed. I included all reports and layout which will help the user access the website and make the changes they need.
  
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  The way I approach designing software is by partioning the work into parts. I begin by seeing what the big picture is and from their creating different supporting documents to help me get the best design for the system before it is implemetned into coding. From there I continue to work in sections to assure a working system.
